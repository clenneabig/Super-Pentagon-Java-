If you would like to save high score times between releases, navagate to the folder with the executable, 
go to the `data` folder and copy the highScore txt files to somewhere, and then when you download the new 
release, put them back in the `data` folder

To launch the game on Windows, navigate the Executables folder, go to the application.windowsXX folder,
where XX is either 32 for x86 systems or 64 for x86_64 systems, double click on Main.exe and the game will 
launch.

To launch the game on Linux, navigate to the Executables folder, if using an x86 or x86_64 system go to either 
application.linuxXX where XX is either 32 for x86 systems or 64 for x86_64 systems, or if you are using an ARMv6 
with a hardware floating point unit, go to application.linux-armv6hf or if you're using an ARM 64-bit system 
go to application.linux-arm64, in the terminal type ./Main to run it.
