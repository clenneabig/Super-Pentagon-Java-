# Super-Pentagon-Java-
My Super Pentagon game using the Processing libraries for Java in the Processing IDE

UI Design by Dylan Wansbrough

The Windows 64 bit version has Java embeded. For the other versions, you may need to download and install 
Java 8.

To download just the folder with the executable that you want, go to releases and download the zip folder you want.

If you would like to save high score times between releases, navagate to the folder with the executable, 
go to the `data` folder and copy the highScore txt files to somewhere, and then when you download the new 
release, put them in the new `data` folder

To launch the game on Windows, navigate to the Executables folder, go to the application.windowsXX folder,
where XX is either 32 for x86 systems or 64 for x86_64 systems, double click on Main.exe and the game will 
launch.

To launch the game on Linux, navigate to the Executables folder, if using an x86 or x86_64 system go to either 
application.linuxXX where XX is either 32 for x86 systems or 64 for x86_64 systems, or if you are using an ARMv6 
with a hardware floating point unit, go to application.linux-armv6hf, or if you're using an ARM 64-bit system 
go to application.linux-arm64, navigate to the applications folder and in the terminal type `chmod +x Main` and then type
./Main to run it.
